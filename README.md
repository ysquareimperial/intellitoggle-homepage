# Frontend Developer Assignment

## Live Demo

[Intellitoggle Homepage](https://intellitoggle-homepage.vercel.app/)

## Notes

- The implementation is fully responsive - both desktop and mobile. Pixelay mobile overlay could not be generated due to extension limitations, but responsiveness can be verified directly on the live site.
- Tradeoff: I focused on making the design responsive and ensuring the UI feels intuitive and appealing within the given timebox.
- With more time, I would:
  - Add more detailed interactivity.
  - Improve accessibility with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
  - Refine image optimization with lazy-loading or Nuxt Image.

## Pixelay Evidence

Screenshots and notes are available in the `/pixelay` folder:  
- `pixelay-desktop.png`  
- `pixelay-mobile.png` (not available due to extension limitation)  
- `notes.md`  

**Limitation:**  
The "Jump to Frame" feature in Pixelay allows you to select projects to compare. However, the Pixelay version I am using in Figma does not have this feature. I have included images showing the Pixelay version I used and the one demonstrated on their official YouTube channel for reference.
