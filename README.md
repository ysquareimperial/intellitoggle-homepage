# Frontend Developer Assignment

## Live Demo

[Intellitoggle Homepage](https://intellitoggle-homepage.vercel.app/)

## Notes

- The implementation is fully responsive - both desktop and mobile. Pixelay mobile overlay could not be generated due to extension limitations, but responsiveness can be verified directly on the live site.
- Tradeoff: I focused on making the design responsive and ensuring the UI feels intuitive and appealing within the given timebox.
- With more time, I would:
  - Add more detailed interactivity.
  - Improve accessibility with ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
  - Refine image optimization with lazy-loading or Nuxt Image.
