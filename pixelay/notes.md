# Pixelay Comparison Notes

- Desktop overlay shows minor differences in font weight (headings appear slightly bolder).  
- Button alignment and spacing differ by about 2â€“3px compared to the design.  
- Some images are arranged slightly differently compared to the Figma layout.

## Note on Mobile
Pixelay didn't allow me to capture the mobile overlay (the option to switch view was not available in my extension setup).  
But the live website is fully responsive, you can view it and resize the browser window or on any device to confirm.
